## Library metadata fields

The library extensions that have "Official metadata" in [this table](./libraries.md) can download metadata for the games from its own library. This is visible as a metadata provider named "Official Store" when applicable, in the mass metadata import window (ctrl+D) as well as at the bottom left of the game edit window.
